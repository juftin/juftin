## Hey, I'm juftin (Justin Flannery) <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30">

I'm a sofware engineer and Python developer based out of Denver, Colorado, USA.

My work with data has spanned from being on the front lines building out Tableau reports to
architecting machine learning recommendation systems. Currently, I work as part of an software engineering team
looking to make heart attacks a thing of the past using machine learing. I'm very interested in machine learning operations, 
big data engineering, distributed systems, and everything open source.

When I'm not coding you can find me camping with my partner and our two dogs, catching a bluebird day
skiing in Colorado, or soaking up the sun at a bluegrass concert.

## What I'm Working On <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif"  width="30">

In my free time I try to build tools and software that spark joy ‚ú®. Below are a few of my more public facing
GitHub repositories and some details about the projects.

### [camply](https://github.com/juftin/camply)

`camply`, the campsite finder ‚õ∫Ô∏è, is a tool to help you book an online campground. Finding
reservations at sold out campgrounds can be tough. That's where `camply` comes in. It searches the
APIs of Booking Services like https://recreation.gov (which works on thousands of campgrounds across
the USA) to continuously check for cancellations and availabilities to pop up. Once a campsite
becomes available, `camply` sends you a notification to book your spot!

You can install camply easily via `pip install camply`.

### [browsr](https://github.com/juftin/browsr)

`browsr` üóÇÔ∏è is a pleasant file explorer in your terminal. It's a command line TUI application
that empowers you to browse the contents of local and remote directories with your keyboard or 
mouse. You can quickly navigate through directories and peek at files whether they're hosted
locally, in AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. View code files with syntax 
highlighting, format JSON files, render images, convert CSV and Parquet files to datatables
and more. Get going with all of `browsr`'s superpowers with `pipx install "browsr[all]"`.

### [lunchable](https://github.com/juftin/lunchable)

[Lunch Money](https://lunchmoney.app/) is a "delightfully simple personal finance & budgeting app" -
and my current tool of choice to manage my finances. `lunchable` üç± is a Python API Client for the
Lunch Money Developer API. It‚Äôs built on top of pydantic, it offers an intuitive API, a simple CLI,
complete coverage of all endpoints and plugins to other external services.

### [homelab](https://github.com/juftin/homelab)

I've always been a big TV and Movies nerd. On the weekends you can find me searching RottenTomatoes
for the latest _certified fresh_ üçÖ pick. `homelab` is a multi-container docker-compose
application that supports every aspect of hosting your own media server at home. `homelab`
includes everything you needto host a website for your friends and
family to request new content be downloaded, services to find and securely download the latest
movies and shows, and underneath it all a Plex media server to support playback of the content
anywhere and on any device. Homelab evolved out of the [media-center](https://github.com/juftin/media-center)
project and most of the documentation hasn't been migrated yet.
